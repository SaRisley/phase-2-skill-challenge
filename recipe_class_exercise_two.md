# {{PROBLEM}} Class Design Recipe

Copy this into a `recipe.md` in your project and fill it out.

## 1. Describe the Problem

As a user
So that I can focus on tasks to complete
I want to mark tasks as complete and have them disappear from the list.

## 2. Design the Class Interface

_Include the initializer, public properties, and public methods with all parameters, return values, and side-effects._

```python
# EXAMPLE

class ToDoList:
    # User-facing properties:
    #   name: string

    def __init__(self):
        # to_do_list as empty list
        pass # No code here yet

    def mark_as_complete(self, task):
        # Parameters:
        #   task: string representing a single task
        # Returns:
        #   Nothing
        #   
        pass # No code here yet

    def remove_completed(self):
        # Returns:
        #   The remaining list with the completed item removed
        # Side-effects:
        #   Throws an exception if no task is set
        pass # No code here yet
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of how the class will behave in different situations._

``` python
# EXAMPLE

"""
MArk a task as complete
"""
to_do_list = ToDoList()
to_do_list.mark_as_complete("Walk the dog") # => "Walk the dog COMPLETED"

"""
Removed completed tasks from to do list
"""
to_do_list = ToDoList()
to_do_list.remove_completed() # removes completed tasks from list and return the list

"""
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
