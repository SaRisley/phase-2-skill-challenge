# {{PROBLEM}} Class Design Recipe

Copy this into a `recipe.md` in your project and fill it out.

## 1. Describe the Problem

As a user
So that I can keep track of my tasks
I want a program that I can add todo tasks to and see a list of them.

## 2. Design the Class Interface

_Include the initializer, public properties, and public methods with all parameters, return values, and side-effects._

```python
# EXAMPLE

class ToDoList:
    # User-facing properties:
    #   name: string

    def __init__(self):
        # Parameters:
        #   name: none
        # Side effects:
        #   none
        pass # No code here yet

    def add_to_do(self, task):
        # Parameters:
        #   task: string representing a single task
        # Returns:
        #   Nothing
        # Side-effects
        #   Saves the task to the self object
        pass # No code here yet

    def list_to_dos(self):
        # Returns:
        #   The to do list
        # Side-effects:
        #   Throws an exception if no task is set
        pass # No code here yet
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of how the class will behave in different situations._

``` python
# EXAMPLE

"""
Add a task to the to-do list and return the list
#remind reminds the user to do the task
"""
to_do = ToDoList()
to_do.add_to_do("Walk the dog")
to_do.list_to_dos() # => ["Walk the dog"]

"""
Throw an exception if list called but it is empty
"""
to_do = ToDoList()
to_do.list_to_dos() # => ["Nothing to do!"]
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
